# dcabs1

> Compute the sum of the [absolute value][absolute-value] of the real part and imaginary part of a double-precision [complex][@stdlib/complex/float64] floating-point number.

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var dcabs1 = require( '@stdlib/blas/base/dcabs1' );
```

#### dcabs1( z )

Computes the sum of the [absolute value][absolute-value] of the real part and imaginary part of a double-precision [complex][@stdlib/complex/float64] floating-point number.

```javascript
var Complex128 = require( '@stdlib/complex/float64' );

var y = dcabs1( new Complex128( 5.0, 3.0 ) );
// returns 8.0
```

var z;
var i;
for ( i = 0; i < 100; i++ ) {
    z = new Complex128( discreteUniform( -50, 50 ), discreteUniform( -50, 50 ) );
    console.log( 'dcabs1(%s) = %d', z.toString(), dcabs1( z ) );
